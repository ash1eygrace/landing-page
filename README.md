# landing-page

## About this Project

This project is a simple landing page created with HTML, CSS, and Flexbox as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

It's a small project designed to have the learner strategically break a solution down into small bits, think about when to commit, get familiar with Git, GitHub, and other tools to build a workflow and muscle memory. 

## The Objective:

The objective was to create a landing page on a topic you're interested in. Then add relevant copy and images. 

Since my goal isn't to become a designer, I decided just to clone the provided screenshot mockup and styles they supplied as shown below:
